		<h2>What is snowboard?</h2>
		<p>
			Snowboarding is a winter sport that involves descending a slope that is covered with snow while standing on
			a board attached to a rider's feet, using a special boot set onto a mounted binding. The development of
			snowboarding was inspired by skateboarding, sledding, surfing and skiing. It was developed in the United
			States in the 1960s to 1970s and became a Winter Olympic Sport in 1998.
		</p>
		<p>
			Snowboarding has been around since the 1920s, when boys and men would tie plywood or wooden planks from
			barrels to their feet using clotheslines and horse reins in order to steer themselves down hills. Modern
			snowboarding began in 1965 when Sherman Poppen, an engineer in Muskegon, Michigan, invented a toy for his
			daughter by fastening two skis together and attaching a rope to one end so she would have some control as
			she stood on the board and glided downhill.

		<h2>Types of snowboarding</h2>
		<div class="row">
			<dl>
				<div class="column">
					<dt>FREERIDING</dt>
					<dd>Freeriding is exactly that—riding at one’s leisure in any terrain and only bound by the
						mountain. This type of riding is best portrayed by the pursuit of riding massive peaks, but it’s
						not solely restricted to that. Riding natural features and adding freestyle elements to them is
						common. This riding style is limited by access to mountains and threatened by the dangers that
						exist (avalanches, crevasses) when seeking to ride in distant areas.</dd><br>
					<dt>FREESTYLE</dt>
					<dd>Whether in terrain parks, backcountry or urban environments— this broad term describes all
						riding where tricks are performed. Freestyle riding is, and continues to be a popular style of
						riding, especially with the continuous progression of features and tricks. Its future is only
						restricted to one’s creativity on a snowboard.</dd>
				</div>
				<div class="column">
					<dt>URBAN</dt>
					<dd>This style of riding is characterized by the use of existing features within or around urban and
						human-made landscapes. Handrails, ledges, parking structures, walls, etc. These features offer a
						playground for riding outside of resorts. The progression of street riding has surged in the
						last handful years as the level of riding has further adapted to such surroundings. It’s the
						most accessible form of riding for many younger riders and continues to grow.</dd>
					<dt>HALF PIPE</dt>
					<dd>Made popular by the last four Olympics, this part of snowboarding involves performing tricks
						while riding through a massive U-shaped snow feature at high speeds. Adapted form skateboard
						vert riding, snowboard half pipe has changed dramatically from the rudimentary days of riding
						natural gullies to today’s massive pipe productions that implement specialized snow machines and
						precision shaping. Larger pipes continue to allow riders to ride faster, go bigger and invent
						new tricks. However, the considerable time and financial costs of creating and maintaining
						pipes, as well as their limited accessibility pose a threat to its evolution.</dd>
